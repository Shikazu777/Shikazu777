Hi there! 👋

I'm Dhanraj, a Full Stack Developer (MERN) and aspiring AI Engineer.

I build scalable web applications and backend systems with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.  
I'm currently expanding into Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence, preparing for a Master's and long-term tech career in Germany.

I'm interested in large-scale, high-impact systems, structured architecture, and intelligent products powered by data.

Previously, I participated in the IND–MYS International Immersion Programme, working on digital transformation case studies in international teams.

Outside of development, I study AI systems, improve backend design skills, and build production-focused applications.
